## Challenge: improve your animation

Can you change the numbers in your animation code so that:

+ The spaceship moves until it touches the Earth?
+ The spaceship moves more slowly towards the Earth?

You'll need to change the numbers in this block:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks
glide (1) secs to x:(0) y:(0)
```

[[[generic-scratch-coordinates]]]
